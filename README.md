# **ALVIS** 
**Discord bot, by [PacketCloudâ„¢](https://packetcloud.com)**  
*Version: 1.7.5*  
## Description
**ALVIS** (**A**synchronous **L**earning **V**irtual **I**ntelligence **S**ystem) is a server management and utility bot built for the voice and text chat service, *[Discord](https://discordapp.com)*. It utilizes Google's [API.AI](https://api.ai) servers to introduce natural language request processing to the bot. Allowing for communication in plain English - not just commands. We are constantly expanding ALVIS' modules, features and knowledge base. We also have plans to add voice support in the future.  

## Setting Up The Bot
Before the bot will run, you must first set up a few values in the config files:
### Requirements:
You must have a Discord bot token and Google API.AI key for an agent with proper Intents and Entities.
Please [contact us](https://packetcloud.com/about) if you need further information about the API.AI agent.  
You will also need a Wolfram API key, though in the future this will be changed to be *optional*; adding support for Wolfram knowledgebase lookup in chat bot functionality. There will also be more modules like this to come; which will also be optional.

### Tokens:
Enter your Discord bot token, API.AI agent key, and Wolfram API key into the config JSON file (*./config/config.json*).

### User Permissions:
In the permissions JSON file (*./config/permissions.json*), add the names of the roles on your Discord server(s) that you want associated to bot permissions.
People with *manager_role* will be allowed to use all bot commands, *admin_role* grants administrative commands.  
The *default_role* is the name of the role you want the bot to assign all new users. This one is optional.

## Changing Settings
You can change bot settings manually in the configuration files within the 'config' folder.
Please do not mess with other files unless you know what you are doing.

## Adding Sounds
You can add music and sounds simply by adding audio files to the 'music' and 'sounds' directories. They must be in a format supported by Discord; we recommend MP3 or WAV.
New audio must then be added to the sound or music library with `!addsound` or `!addmusic` commands.
Alternatively, you can add all audio in the respective folders to the library with `!addallsounds` or `!addallmusic`, but then the audio file names will be used (instead of custom ones).
`!purgesounds` or `!purgemusic` can be used to clear the database.
