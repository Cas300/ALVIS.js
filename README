Settings:
You can change bot settings manually in constants.js
Please do not mess with variables.js unless you know what you are doing.

Adding Sounds:
You can add music and sounds simply by adding files to the 'music' and 'sounds' directories.
They MUST be .mp3 format, and their filenames MUST consist strictly alphanumeric characters and underscores.

Future Changes:
In the future, there may be configuration files instead of changing settings in a .js file.
